# Biography

I am a historian of early modern England, currently undertaking a PhD at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of Dr David Smith. My doctoral project focuses on the regicide of Charles I as a traumatic and disruptive event, and its impact on conceptions of time and the future. I examine the temporal narratives of contemporaries publishing during and after the English Civil War, including astrologers, historians, and newsbooks editors and writers of the later Stuart and Commonwealth periods. 

I completed my MSc at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, a graduate school of Nanyang Technological University, where I focused on aspects of discourse analysis and the role of imagined spaces in the domain of international law and diplomacy. I graduated with my joint degree in History from the National University of Singapore and the Australian National University, where I first started working on early modern England.

Accredited as an Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (AFHEA) in September 2018. The HEA benchmarks excellence in higher education teaching against the UK Professional Standards Framework (UKSPF).
